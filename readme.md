**2. PROJECT ARCHITECTURE**
The application features 3-layer hexagonal architecture:
    - domain/core layer with two ports/interfaces: Storate interface and Service interface
    - service layer
    - transport layer
Dependencies are directed outwards and inner layers are not aware of what is happening on outer layer(s).

**3. The project represents a RESTful API with the following endpoints:**
    - "/auth/register" (POST): user registration form which helps to create users with unique email addresses. No users with duplicated emails are allowed.
	- "/auth/login" (POST): this is a user login form which checks login (email) and password of an user, and if successful, it returns an access and a refresh JWT tokens for operations described below;
	- "/user/profile" (GET): retrieves user info in case of a valid JWT token;
	- "/user/profile" (PUT): parses Metamask signature and a string signed by Metamask and saves an Etherium public address into the Postgres database.

**5. TESTING**

TO RUN THE SERVER AND TEST IT WITH REQUESTS YOU CAN USE THE FOLLOWING:

--curl:
<!-- Srart the server -->
1.1. With Docker-compose
    $ Docker-compose up // the easieast way to run it

OR

1.2 with the following set of commands:

$ make postgres

$ make createdb

$ make migrateup

$ make start-server

<!-- Run Register User command -->
2. curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--request POST  \
--data '{
    "first_name": "Adam",
    "last_name": "Smith",
    "password": "123456789",
    "email": "economy@ac.gov.uk"
}' http://localhost:8080/auth/register

<!-- Run Login command -->
3. curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--request POST  \
--data '{
    "password": "123456789",
    "email": "economy@ac.gov.uk"}' http://localhost:8080/auth/login

<!-- Run Get User command: replace '{token}' with JWT token received in the step 3 -->
4. curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--request GET  \
-H "Authorization: Bearer {token}" \
--data '{
    "password": "123456789",
    "email": "economy@ac.gov.uk"}' http://localhost:8080/user/profile

<!-- Run Update User command which passes login info, signed string from Metamask and a signature from Metamask, parses them and saved public Eth address into the database. Replace '{token}' with JWT token received in the step 3 -->
5. curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--request PUT  \
-H "Authorization: Bearer {token}" \
--data '{
    "password": "123456789",
    "email": "economy@ac.gov.uk",
    "signed_message": "0x54686973206973206vd79206e6577206d657373616765",
    "signature": "4cc9b720ca28cc5660d0c8b713fd5016e84f102ba242e86cd891ba17d88db8cc4a6257f0807a6fd3503df9a6f3c18d13d2de2efa88b143e079db4bf121012eac1b"}' http://localhost:8080/user/profile

the same can be done with Postman.
